# Knight Rider Simulation
- Using Proteus Design Suite, I simulate my Knight Rider C code.
- Also You can find RotatingDot.c and simulation files.

## How It Works?
- You can find hex code of c code.
- In Proteus Design, I use PIC 16 chip. This use hex code.
- All the elements have been added.
- Add the .hex file to the PIC MCU in Proteus.
## RUN
